# Getting and Cleaning data course project
My submission of the Getting and cleaning data course project.

The script run_analysis.R does 5 things in 5 steps:

1. Merging the training and the test sets to create one data set
2. Extracting  only the measurements on the mean and SD
3. Using descriptive activity names to name the activities
4. Appropriately labeling the data set with descriptive variable names
5. From the data set in step 4, creating a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject 

Details of particular steps in each of the 5 steps above are in the comments directly in the sctipt itself.
